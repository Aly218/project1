  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Welcome to my profile! My name is Nidia Guadarrama. I am a freshman in Information Technology and Management. I am interested in encouraging more people to use technology to help them in their everyday lives. I hope to accomplish this by protecting user data in order to promote safe application usage.</p> 
  <p>Outside of work, I enjoy reading and listening to music to relax. I am currently seeking part-time positions to contribute to honing my communication skills and problem-solving abilities as well as to gain work experience.</p>
